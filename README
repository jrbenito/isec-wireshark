Intelbras company uses a protocol called ISECnet to communicate
between their security products like alarm panels, DVRs, NVRs,
etc. Yet they do not release any public information regarding
the protocol, if asked, support will send documentation as SDK.

This plugin decodes ISECnet protocol used to communicate with
Intelbras alarm panels (at the momento of this writing there
are two models available the AMT-2018E and AMT-2018EG).

This software is released under GPL by author but he is not
in charge nor can be responsible for any protocol change or
any consequence this dissection can cause. Use it only for
research purposes and AT YOUR OWN RISK
